Calendars are important parts of our daily lives. In fact, I don’t think I have ever met a single person who doesn’t use a calendar.
Think about any of the times you have seen movies or television shows where someone was trapped, imprisoned, or stranded for a long period of time. 
What is one of the things they always do? Keep track of the number of days they were there or create their own calendar.
Here are some uses of calendar app:
1. Use Easily Access from Multiple Devices
2. Schedule Meetings and Appointments
3. Set up Reminders
4. Block Time in Your Day
      Calendars can be used as a way to increase your productivity. One example of this is through time blocks.
      You can schedule time to work on important projects allowing you to complete those that are a priority or have deadlines.
      You can use the online calendar as a tool to help you get done what is needed and stay on task. 
5. Create Recurring Events in Your Calendar
The use of calender in my every day life encouraged me to attempt to create the code.
